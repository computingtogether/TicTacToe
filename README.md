```
$ ruby Main.rb
```
To quit the game type ctrl + c

This game gives players the option of choosing what size board they play on. The game most likely has a much higher chance of ending in a draw for games with dimensions above 3x3. Some improvements might include giving each player a number of consecutive moves in a row based upon how much larger the board size is than 3x3.

Some of the code in these files needs to be refactored, especially in the Board.rb file.
