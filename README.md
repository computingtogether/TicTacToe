# Tic Tac Toe

This program is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe) Ruby Programming path

To play the game, when you are in the directory containing these files, in the terminal enter:
```
$ ruby Main.rb
```
To quit the game type ctrl + c

This game gives players the option of chosing what size board they play on. The game most likely has a much higher chance of ending in a draw for games dimensions above 3x3. Some improvements might include giving each player a number of consecutive moves in a row based upon how much larger the board size is than 3x3.

Some of the code in these files needs to be refactored, especially in the Board.rb file.
